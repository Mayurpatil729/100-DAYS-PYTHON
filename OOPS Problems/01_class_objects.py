# ### 🔧 What is a **Constructor** (`__init__`)?

# * A **special method** in Python classes.
# * Automatically runs **when an object is created**.
# * Used to **initialize** the object (set its starting values like name, age, brand, etc.).
# * Looks like this:

#   ```python
#   def __init__(self, ...):
#   ```

# ---

# ### 🧍 What is **`self`**?

# * **Not a keyword** — just a **convention** (common name).
# * Refers to the **current object** being used or created.
# * Must be the **first parameter** in all instance methods.
# * Helps you access or store data in that **specific object**.

# ### ✅ Key Points

# | Concept              | Summary                                                               |
# | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
# | `__init__`           | Python's constructor; sets up the object with initial values          |
# | `self`               | Refers to the current object ("this" object)                          |
# | Is `self` a keyword? | ❌ No, but it's conventionally used and required as the first argument |
# | Is `self` required?  | ✅ Yes, for all instance methods (including `__init__`)                |
# | Can I rename `self`? | ✅ Technically yes, but don't — it's bad practice                      |

# 🏗️ What is a Constructor?
# Imagine you're making toys in a toy factory.
# You have a blueprint (called a class) for making a toy car.
# Every time you want to create a new toy car, someone has to assemble it — like adding wheels, painting it, giving it a name.
# That "someone" is the constructor in Python — it’s a special function called __init__.
# Think of this as:
# Car: the blueprint
# __init__: the constructor who builds each car with its own brand and model

# 🧍 What is self?
# Think of self as the word "this one".
# When you're making many cars, Python needs to know:
# “Which car are we talking about?”
# So self means:
# “This car”
# “This object”
# “This thing I’m creating or using right now”

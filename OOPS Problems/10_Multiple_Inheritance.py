# multiple inheritance.

# üß¨ What is Multiple Inheritance?
# In Python, a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This is known as multiple inheritance.
# It means a child class can get:
# Attributes
# Methods
# from two or more parent classes.


# üîÅ Method Resolution Order (MRO)
# When multiple parents have a method with the same name, Python uses MRO (left to right) to decide which one to call.
# MRO (Method Resolution Order) tells Python in what order to look for a method or attribute when multiple classes are involved.
# It‚Äôs especially important when:
# A class inherits from multiple parent classes
# More than one parent has methods with the same name

# ‚úÖ Rule:
# Python follows the order from left to right as defined in the class declaration.
# It uses something called the C3 Linearization algorithm (but you don‚Äôt need to memorize that ‚Äî understanding the order is more important).
